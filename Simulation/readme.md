This folder contains Matlab code used in simulating a pair of spinners. The main scripts to run are "run_sim_dimensional.m" and "simrealistic.m". "run_sim_dimensional.m" is the set of code wherein all experimental parameters are provided along with initial conditions to simulate the evolution of the spinner pair. If one wishes to visualize the solution to the set of ODEs simulated, "simrealistic.m" plots the evolution of the pair. The helper function "oscillator_onlywave_dimensional.m" computes the force and torque calculations between the point sources which comprise each of the spinners. Each spinner is made up of point sources which are arranged according to the "constructspinnerskel.m" function. All other functions are helper functions used for computing the wave-mediated and capillary attraction forces.
