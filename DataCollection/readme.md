This folder contains all experimentally collected data presented in the manuscript. The "AmplitudeDeath", "Bistability", and "NonIdenticalTrials" all contain time-series data recorded at 3 frames-per-second (fps) and correspond to Figures 7,2, and 6, respectively. "DistanceSweep" and "FrequencySweep" contain the mean and standard deviation of the equilibrium phase angle which correspond to Figure 3.
